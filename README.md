COP 3003 - Business Inventory Order Software

What Does It Do?

This software will make an order form for any 'business' and the order will have the creator name, items used, and order ID number. The software can open, create, and close orders.

Why Make This?

Mainly for a project. but also for a future use if I ever need a storage inventory based software.

This is a storage for the COP 3003 Programming Project

-DATE: FEBUARY 13 2023- 
This file will not have a fancy GUI and use a more console based format (WIP). 
This code will work in conjunction with a JSON database to hold the 'Order' and NOT the employee names as an array does it just fine. 
Please do not expect the New Entry to function currently. 
There is not much due to struggles entailing the GUI and JSON database.
